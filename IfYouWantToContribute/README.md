# Welcome, potential contributor!

Three kinds of contributions are needed:

1. Exercises
2. Self-assessments
3. Ancillary materials

## Contributing exercises

Please keep in mind the target audience: people who are hesitant about learning to program. Each exercise must be short, doable, and appropriate.

That said, any and all suggestions will be considered. Please do not be offended if your pull request is not added!

## Self-assessments

After each lesson (well, except those that do not teach any new Julia programming), a short self-assessment in the form of a few multiple-choice questions is required. There could even be several of these per lesson; each student will decide for themselves how many to do, after all.

## Ancillary materials

* Cheat sheets are usually very condensed. We are really unsure what sort of cheat sheet would work best for code-hesitant people, so your ideas would be welcome.
* Short projects appropriate at various stages. Please keep these text-focussed, if possible.
* Something like an ANKI deck (or several) would be a very interesting contribution.
* And of course ideas we've missed.
